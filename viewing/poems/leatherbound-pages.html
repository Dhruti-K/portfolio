          <h3>Leatherbound Pages</h3>
          <p>Leatherbound pages, crisp and clean <br>
              Beneath a flurry of paper <br>
              Ink, laughter, and her memories <br>
              Strewn upon the cherished sheets <br> 
              â€˜Til excitement ebbed and the pages met <br>
              A seemingly perpetual darkness <br>
              <br>
              Leatherbound pages, covered in dust <br>
              Found in the depths of all that is lost and old <br>
              Flipped through by her prying hands <br>
              Tossed away by the very pair <br>
              And flown to the other end of the world <br>
              ...perhaps they were forgotten <br>
              <br>
              Leatherbound pages, clutched to her chest <br>
              In joy, confusion, and agony <br>
              Privy to the thoughts deep in her mind <br>
              More of a friend than a man could be <br> 
              Tear-stained, ink-blotted, through wear and tear <br>
              But treasured, nonetheless <br> 
              <br>
              Leatherbound pages, how lonely they were <br>
              Though she sat right by their side <br>
              Staring, thinking, and maybe remembering <br>
              What could she write within? <br>
              Then alien gloves stole the pages away <br>
              And all she could do was watch <br>
              <br>
              Leatherbound pages, long forgotten <br>
              Her words, fading away <br>
              Covers torn, sheets ripped, all covered in dirt <br>
              A full life, they had lived <br>
              But the pages refused to believe this <br>
              The pages still waited for her return <br>

            Description
          </h3>
          <p>
            This poem was the first that I had written on my own accord 
            for a long time, and is still one of my favorites. It, like
            most of my poems, is NOT based on my own experiences/myself, 
            and the "she"/"her" is simply a nondescript character.
            <br>
            <br>
            The poem is supposed to be about passage through a person's 
            life; in this case, the person is "her". The first verse is
            childhood, specifically a birthday. The "flurry of paper" refers
            to wrapping paper and the way the girl quickly forgot about the 
            journal is common among children. The second verse takes place 
            when the girl is leaving home, perhaps to college. She finds the journal 
            again and puts it in the box that she is packing her belongings 
            in. The third verse takes place when the girl is middle-aged. 
            She finds the journal when she is undergoing hardships and 
            it is a very useful friend to her. In the fourth verse, the girl 
            is ill, and cannot write in the journal either because she is 
            physically incapable or because she forgot how to. By the last verse, 
            the journal has made its way to a junkyard. The girl is presumably 
            dead and the journal is forgotten about.
