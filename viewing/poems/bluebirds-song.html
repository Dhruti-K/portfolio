            <h3>Bluebird's Song</h3>
          <p>
            Lovely is the bluebird’s song <br>
            Enchanting to the ear <br>
            Carried through the winter’s air <br>
            For all  who will listen <br>
            <br>
            Beautiful is the melody <br>
            Filled with a kind of agony <br>
            For the bluebird has much to say <br>
            And nobody really hears <br>
            <br>
            If only they could understand <br>
            The bluebird’s pleads and calls <br>
            If only someone would understand <br>
            Its chilling, longing cries <br>
            <br>
            But the bird can do naught but sing <br>
            Sing, until there’s nothing left <br>
            For all that it can truly make <br>
            Is the music <br>
            <br>
            The bird has seen far and wide <br>
            It has seen both the good and bad <br>
            It has seen wonders, it has seen pain <br>
            And it longs to let them know <br>
            <br>
            Lonely is the bluebird’s song <br>
            Full of wishes and foolish dreams <br>
            It is so much more than simple music <br>
            If only they would know <br>
            <br>
            Hopeful are the bluebird’s notes <br>
            For surely, in this world so vast <br>
            There is someone, somewhere, in a far-off land <br>
            Someone who will understand. <br>
