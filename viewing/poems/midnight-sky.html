            <h3>Midnight Sky</h3>
            <p>
              The world changes <br>
              For that is its nature <br>
              It comes as no surprise <br>
              <br>
              The world changes <br>
              Again and again <br>
              Until everything is wrong <br>
              <br>
              Friends become foes <br>
              And trees become stumps <br>
              And fields become naught but black <br>
              <br>
              But every night <br>
              There is one <br>
              That proves the world wrong <br>
              <br>
              Midnight strikes <br>
              The sky is dark <br>
              It is black. It is a void. <br>
              <br>
              Midnight strikes <br>
              And darkness swallows <br>
              Darkness coats me in perpetual comfort <br>
              <br>
              Like an old friend <br>
              One of love and heart <br>
              The darkness is always there <br>
              <br>
              Until one night <br>
              I step outside <br>
              And that, too, has left me. <br>
