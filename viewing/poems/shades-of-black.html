            <h3>Shades of Black</h3>
          <p>
            How do we see <br>
            What stands before our eyes <br>
            If it is forever cloaked in darkness? <br>
            <br>
            How can we discern <br>
            What is right, and what is not <br>
            If it remains this way? <br>
            <br>
            How can we decide <br>
            Which path we shall walk <br>
            If we are never given light? <br>
            <br>
            How are we told <br>
            That our choices are our mistakes <br>
            If there is nothing to choose? <br>
            <br>
            How do the people say <br>
            That everything is clear <br>
            When all we see is dust? <br>
            <br>
            And how can the world expect us <br>
            To see what we are given <br>
            To see what is before our eyes <br>
            <br>
            How can the world expect us <br>
            To see its true colors <br>
            When they are all but shades of black? <br>
            <br>
