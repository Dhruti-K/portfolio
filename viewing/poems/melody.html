          <h3>Melody</h3>
          <p>
            Fingers dance on a stage of wood <br>
            My hand glides, and with it, the bow <br>
            Gentle tugs and flowing notes <br>
            Back and forth <br>
            Smoothly, it flows <br>
            And there it is <br>
            Melody <br>
            <br>
            These hands of mine <br>
            Give life to the notes <br>
            Sweet and sour, bright and dull <br>
            Created in but a moment <br>
            And though they may be gone <br>
            In the very same, <br>
            They still live forever <br>
            <br>
            Is it flawless? <br>
            Of course not. <br>
            Is it virtuosic? <br>
            Perhaps it isnâ€™t. <br>
            Is there better? <br>
            Maybe so. <br>
            But it is perfect all the same <br>
            <br>
            The notes fly <br>
            Through the damp air <br>
            They flutter by <br>
            Like little birds <br>
            They swing and twirl <br>
            And leap and bound <br>
            In ecstasy <br>
            <br>
            It is fleeting, the moment <br>
            But so full, so true <br>
            They are fleeting, the notes <br>
            As I make each with care <br>
            It is fleeting, the music <br>
            But even when it is heard no longer <br>
            It still lives forever <br>
            <br>
