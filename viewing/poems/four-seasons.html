            <h3>Four Seasons</h3>
          <p>
            It was spring <br>
            And the flowers bloomed bright <br>
            And children ran amongst <br>
            The verdant grass <br>
            <br>
            It was spring <br>
            And the people gathered <br>
            With all those they loved <br>
            And they laughed <br>
            <br>
            It was spring <br>
            The air was light <br>
            And the people were joyous <br>
            All was very well <br>
            <br>
            It was summer <br>
            The heat was strong <br>
            And the plants were not <br>
            And the people were even less so <br>
            <br>
            It was summer <br>
            And the people cowered <br>
            They hid in dimmed shadows <br>
            With fear <br>
            <br>
            It was summer <br>
            In came another <br>
            Brash and sweltering, with a fireâ€™s rage <br>
            It burned <br>
            <br>
            It was autumn <br>
            The flames had subsided <br>
            But the people still hid <br>
            From what? I cannot say <br>
            <br>
            It was autumn <br>
            The leaves were old and decayed <br>
            The people were tired of their lives <br>
            But they lived them as they were <br>
            <br>
            It was autumn <br>
            And it was better, I suppose <br>
            But from their windows <br>
            The people saw no change <br>
            <br>
            It was winter <br>
            And the foliage was gone <br>
            It was empty, the world <br>
            But at least it had left <br>
            <br>
            It was winter <br>
            And the people stepped out <br>
            Into the cold and the bleak <br>
            Out of hiding, once more <br>
            <br>
            It was winter <br>
            All was gone, it seemed <br>
            But nothing is still better <br>
            Than the fear <br>
            <br>
            And then the leaves <br>
            Shot up from the trees <br>
            And the people began <br>
            To smile <br>
            <br>
            There was joy again <br>
            And dancing and merriment <br>
            And the sweet sugared chimes <br>
            Of laughter <br>
            <br>
            The fear was not truly gone <br>
            But it was never again seen <br>
            The flames were only light <br>
            And the heat was only warmth <br>
            <br>
            It was not as it once was <br>
            But it was about as close <br>
            As one could wish <br>
            <br>
            The people had waited <br>
            And the time was over <br>
            And peace had reemerged <br>
            <br>
            For it was spring <br>
            <br>
