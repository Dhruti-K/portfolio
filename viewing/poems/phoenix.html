            <h3>Phoenix</h3>
          <p>
            Bird of feathers as bright as the sun <br>
            As radiant as a thousand stars <br>
            With an entrancing song <br>
            And a crown of red <br>
            And all the smugness of a king <br>
            <br>
            Bird of dulled orange shade <br>
            Fit comfortably in my arms <br>
            Its calls were milder <br>
            Its regality was abandoned <br>
            But it was beautiful, all the same <br>
            <br>
            Bird of unremarkable manner <br>
            Gone was its extravagant plumage <br>
            It cawed for my attention <br>
            But I passed it away <br>
            And it slept more than it was awake <br>
            <br>
            Bird that was barely a bird any longer <br>
            And of rather unpleasant color <br>
            It sat all day by the edge of its cage <br>
            From the corner of my eye, I watched it limp <br>
            And watched it fall, so often <br>
            <br>
            Gone was the bird, so quiet, so fast <br>
            One moment, it was there, then not <br>
            No feathers, no caws, no miserable lump <br>
            And so I sifted my hand through the soot <br>
            And waited for it to rise <br>
            <br>
            But it never did rise, the bird <br>
            And I never did know why <br>
            <br>
