            <h3>World in Flames</h3>
            <p>
              Dewdrop fell from tender leaf <br>
              To the parched ground below <br>
              Gently, with a certain grace <br>
              As the leaf swayed in the wind <br>
              <br>
              Dusk settled on the atmosphere <br>
              The moon rising high <br>
              Stars hidden behind thickets <br>
              Of dense, gray smoke <br>
              <br>
              There was odd beauty in the fire <br>
              As it swallowed the spindly grass <br>
              As it turned the vibrant, verdant hills <br>
              To an expanse of muddied ash <br>
              <br>
              There was an elegance in the flickering flames <br>
              As they engulfed the ruins of wood <br>
              The remnants of the world before <br>
              All gone, without a witness <br>
              <br>
              The trees, once of great majesty <br>
              Fell victim to the destruction <br>
              Reduced to naught but a memory <br>
              In the minds of people past <br>
              <br>
              The flowers, once of great splendor <br>
              Were prey to the preying blaze <br>
              And though the colors, so bright, were forever gone <br>
              The embers brought a sense of peace <br>
              <br>
              Dewdrop fell from tender leaf <br>
              Life, in pure desolation <br>
              A sign that soon, in due time <br>
              The world will be built again. <br>
