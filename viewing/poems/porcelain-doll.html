          <h3>Porcelain Doll</h3>
          <p>
            I feel their eyes bore into me <br>
            Have they no shame? <br>
            They stare as if I am a show <br>
            As if I am a lion, jumping through hoops <br>
            As if I am a diamond, in a case of glass <br>
            As if I am not a person myself <br>
            <br>
            I am respected, they have said <br>
            I am above them, I am better <br>
            Yet in their eyes, there is no respect <br>
            If anything, there is ridicule <br>
            And maybe if I were one of them <br>
            I would ridicule, as well <br>
            <br>
            Men stand like pillars of iron <br>
            Like the bars of a bird’s cage <br>
            For of course, even when I am outside <br>
            I am still behind a wall <br>
            And even as I walk <br>
            I am being carried along <br>
            <br>
            Every movement is watched <br>
            Every movement is careful <br>
            For if I take a wrong step <br>
            I may fall, they think, I may shatter <br>
            They treat me like a porcelain doll <br>
            As if I am made of glass <br>
            <br>
            The river is full of beauty <br>
            Not the beauty that I hold <br>
            But raw beauty <br>
            The beauty of nature <br>
            Beauty with unrelenting power <br>
            What I could never be <br>
            <br>
            I take a step on one of the stones <br>
            I take a step on the next <br>
            I take a step and it is not on a stone <br>
            I take a step and I fall <br>
            But as I land, I do not shatter <br>
            I simply bleed <br>
            <br>
            Everyone worries. <br>
            Everyone says that this is terrible. <br>
            They say that this was foolish. <br>
            A terrible idea. <br>
            But I do not. <br>
            I don’t see why. <br>
            <br>
            They fuss over me <br>
            As if I am not capable <br>
            They fuss over me <br>
            As if I am too meek <br>
            Too weak, too inexperienced <br>
            To handle a wound so small <br>
            <br>
            And I think that the people <br>
            Are right <br>
            To ridicule. <br>
            <br>
            They treat me as if I am a porcelain doll <br>
            But people aren’t made of glass <br>
            <br>
