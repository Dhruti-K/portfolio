          <h3>Choice</h3>
          <p>Footstep by footstep, along its bank <br>
            Never one out of line <br>
            Follow the footpath and soon you’ll be home <br>
            The everlasting routine of life <br>
            <br>
            Taunting river, with its roars and calls <br>
            The girl pays it no heed <br>
            Beautiful river, with its snow white foam <br>
            So enticing, beguiling, alluring— <br>
            <br>
            Silly girl. <br>
            Water isn’t alluring. <br>
            Water is nothing new. <br>
            <br>
            Silly girl. <br>
            These thoughts are foolish. <br>
            You have everything you need. <br>
            <br>
            To the grocer’s shop is a long walk <br>
            On the path down the flower beds <br>
            Ten pence in pocket, five in hand <br>
            And the blackbird’s song, always the same <br>
            <br>
            Tempting flowers, swaying in the wind <br>
            The girl <em>tries</em> to pay them no heed <br>
            Enchanting flowers, full of color <br>
            So wonderful, exciting, new— <br>
            <br>
            Foolish girl. <br>
            You’ve seen flowers. <br>
            Mother grows many at home. <br>
            <br>
            Foolish girl. <br>
            This is all unnecessary. <br>
            You have everything you need. <br>
            <br>
            Girl at home, by the window <br>
            Staring at the great outdoors <br>
            She has seen them lots, been there more <br>
            Yet she still longs <br>
            <br>
            Pitiable girl. <br>
            You’re crazy. <br>
            What is there to long for? <br>
            <br>
            Pitiable girl. <br>
            So privileged, so blessed. <br>
            You have everything you need. <br>
            <br>
            Tired girl. <br>
            You come home to food. <br>
            A warm fireplace. <br>
            <br>
            Tired girl. <br>
            You have been well-rested. <br>
            The tiredness doesn’t leave. <br>
            <br>
            Working girl. <br>
            Simple, quick. <br>
            You’ve done it a million times. <br>
            <br>
            Working girl. <br>
            Same old, same old. <br>
            Does nobody ever ask? <br>
            <br>
            Longing girl. <br>
            You have it all. <br>
            But why do you feel this way? <br>
            <br>
            Longing girl. <br>
            Everything in your hands. <br>
            Yet you want the same. <br>
            <br>
            Girl that needs. <br>
            What? She doesn’t know. <br>
            <br>
            Girl that wants. <br>
            What? She couldn’t care less. <br>
            <br>
            Girl that’s missing. <br>
            What? She wishes to know. <br>
            <br>
            For though she has everything, <br>
            She has nothing <br>
            Both, all at once. <br>

            Description
          </h3>
          <p>
            I wrote "Choice" a fair amount of time after I wrote "Leatherbound 
            Pages". To this day, it is one of my favorite poems. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The perspective switches from third to second, from speaking 
            about the girl to the narrator (whose tone I love) reprimanding 
            the girl. This poem's meaning is in its title; it's simply "choice".
            The last three lines are probably my favorites, because their 
            simplicity is exactly what I feel this poem needs. I hope you enjoyed it!
