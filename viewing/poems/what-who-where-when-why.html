          <h3>What/Who/Where/When/Why</h3>
          <p>
            What lies beyond the farthest hill? <br>
            What lies behind the farthest wall? <br>
            What lies in the farthest depth <br>
            Of the neverending sea? <br>
            <br>
            Whose voice is heard in those fragile whispers? <br>
            Whose screams are those that I hear, so faint? <br>
            Whose burrow lies far above <br>
            The ever reaching sky? <br>
            <br>
            Where can I see the final star? <br>
            Where can I hold the final stone? <br>
            Where can I find the final tree <br>
            In this forever growing forest? <br>
            <br>
            When will the roots be forever gone? <br>
            When will the flower take its penultimate bloom? <br>
            When will the leaf be carried away from view <br>
            By the perpetually flowing wind? <br>
            <br>
            Why does the bird continue to fly? <br>
            Why do waves continue to beckon? <br>
            Why does the world continue to turn <br>
            If the sky remains unseeing? <br>
            <br>
